## About

This is Jiachen Chen. Welcome to my homepage!

I am a research assistant at [Center for Methods in Implementation and Prevention Science (CMIPS)](https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/) supervised by Dr. [Donna Spiegelman](https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/profile/donna_spiegelman/). My research interests mainly concentrate in the design and analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal studies, survival analysis and causal inference. I am also interested in machine learning and Bayesian modeling for high dimensional data.

I obtained a MS degree in Biostatistics from Yale School of Public Health in May 2020. For my undergraduate studies, I obtained a BS degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from School of Mathematics at Tianjin University and a dual BS degree in Finance from Nankai University in July 2018.

## About

This is Jiachen Chen. Welcome to my homepage!

I am an incoming PhD student in Biostatistics at Boston University School of Public Health. My research interests mainly concentrate in statistical genetics, the design and analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and causal inference. 

I obtained a MS degree in Biostatistics from Yale School of Public Health in May 2020. I was a research assistant at [Center for Methods in Implementation and Prevention Science (CMIPS)](https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/) supervised by Dr. [Donna Spiegelman](https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/profile/donna_spiegelman/). For my undergraduate studies, I obtained a BS degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from School of Mathematics at Tianjin University and a dual BS degree in Finance from Nankai University in July 2018.
